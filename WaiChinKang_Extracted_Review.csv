5,Great Product,"Like another reviewer (Purple Cloud); I've been purchasing this oil for at least 2 years or longer. I cook quite extenisvely and frequently utilize high end products and equipment to complete my recipes. Many of these items I either purchase online or in specialty food markets. I happened to be reading a cooking magazine or some such material that listed the health and cooking benefits of rice bran oil (helps to reduce cholesterol and it has none, has no trans fats, and has vitamin E among other benefits). This oil also has a very light, almost non-flavor which is great when you lightly sautee delicate vegetables, such as asparagus. I don't want my oil competing with the flavor of my food in some cases. Because of the light flavor, I actually bake with this oil and have absolutely no residual oil taste. I don't even think I own any canola or vegetable oil. I also love the fact that this has a high smoke point (490 degrees) higher than peanut oil as a matter of fact, which is absolutely great when I want to sear meat in a pan. As does everyone else, I also want to save as much money as I can, especially when I am purchasing high end products. To save money purchasing this oil, I actually order this directly from Honest Foods.com, which is cheaper than the listed Amazon price, although this oil is being sold here by Honest Foods. I also look for coupon codes when ordering from Honest Foods to save even more money. I typically also purchase two or more at a time and Honest Foods reduces the price to $8 per 1/2 gallon. I have never had my oil ""go bad"" and simply store it in a cupboard, and I do not deep fry anything, so it's not as if I use mass quantities in short duration. This is a great product and everyone should try it. Also, this product is made and processed right here in the United States.",positive,"Great Product.

5,This stuff rocks!,Wow. A product that is EXACTLY what the label says. One drop of EZ-SWEETS really does sweeten as much as one packet of Splenda. It has no aftertaste at all. No carbs. No calories.

I hate chemical tasting sweeteners but this product is great. No funky flavors. All good. Recommend.,positive,This stuff rocks!. Wow. A product that is EXACTLY what the label says.

1,Gerber's fruits are cooked,"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics.

Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation.

5,Honest Tea Organic Peach White Tea Great Tea,"Loved it! Great mild organic tea and very convenient to have a case or 2 delivered to your front door for free!! Saves time and money. This tea has a mile sweet taste, not to overbearing. It is made with white tea which has the least amount of fluoride in it of all the teas since white tea leaves are the youngest of the tea leaf plant, which is something that green or black tea leaves are not.

1,Burnt taste nothing like Lavazza,"I bought this from Amazon since they don't have this kind of coffee locally. I had purchased the identical brand and boldness about a year ago.  Wow, this stuff doesn't even taste like what I had originally! It has an awful burnt taste that lingers as an aftertaste. It really doesn't even compare to what I had before. They must have changed the beans or reduced the quality because it is not smooth at all and has a bitterness and aftertaste that reminds me of the lingering taste after smoking a cigarette. I've decided to switch brands completely. No returns it so I'm stuck with 3 1/2 bricks of sub-par coffee grounds.",negative,"Burnt taste nothing like Lavazza.

2,"Dry and Edible; they fall apart in your hand, not in your mouth","I ordered these in an attempt to have healthier snacks. I usually enjoyed the taste and texture of rice cakes.

1,Big mistake,"My cat, who has been on a gluten-free all-canned diet for a few years, did not like this food.

I thought my cat would appreciate some variety as would I.  So here I am wide awake at 3 am laundering sheets because immediately after a near liquid litter box episode she bee-lined it for my bed.  Obviously this food is a huge success in some households and I wish more than anyone that my experience was positive too.

5,Picky dog gobbles it up!,"I have two rescue chihuahua mix dogs (2yr old chiweenie 19 lbs. & 7mo jack-chi 9.6 lbs.). Both have started turning into butterballs from extra treats given during training as well as not enough walks, and could each lose 1-3 pounds. We've stepped up exercise but I still wanted a food that would help maintain their weight because they're both low to the ground and weight gain prone. My bf and I have been searching and searching for the ""right"" food to give them both. The choices and information on dog food is insane and combined with finding food they'll both eat is head spinning!<br /><br />The bigger/older one is super picky about all food and is known to spit out treats he doesnt like and to not even sniff new foods he hasn't experienced until u show him or break it up for him, but the little one will gobble anything in a flash. Previously we've had the oldest on Kirkland brand adult food and while he doesn't ""love"" it, he'll eat it with some waffling and overall its proven to keep him solidly healthy. After getting the 2nd pup who has typical jrt skin sensitivities I started researching foods to help him out and switched him from blue buffalo puppy to blue wilderness (also he stopped growing up and started growing out bc of too much puppy food richness which our older one also experienced when he was transitioning to adult). (As most know small dogs can stop growing much sooner compared to large dogs.) We tried to feed blue wilderness to the older one but found that he definitely turned his nose at it and given half and half portions preferred Kirkland over blue. In general I think blue is an awesome food but tends to be a little too calorie dense for our guys. Combined with their recent chubbiness and based on great reviews and ingredients, I decided to try Wellness Super5mix Healthy Weight for small breeds.<br /><br />We've only just bought some a few days go so I'll have to report back on weightloss, but we were super excited that based on first a small sample to each, then second when we mixed a meal with their old food they both immediately gobbled up the food. This is amazing because our oldest has always seemed to tolerate his kibble but hasn't ever loved any brands we've tried to date. This is the first time he's started eating a new food immediately!!

After rinsing and boiling for a few minutes I added it to pre-made frozen pouch of soup (Tabachnic Creamy Spinach 90 cal)... and it was orgasmic.

4,CHOPPED UP FRUIT IN CAN- YUM,"UPDATE_ July 2012<br /><br />I found a great way to beat the summer heat- i empty a can of this fruit cocktail into a freezer safe bowl- leave it in the freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours- and then i get to eat lightly frozen fruit cocktail- it's very refreshing and cooling_and the entire can is only like 150 calories.  i suppose i could also throw the gently frozen fruit into a blender and make a sorbet of sorts--i'm just finishing a bowl of gently frozen libby's peaches- peach sorbet would be yummy<br />-----------<br /><br />The best part is the no added sugar.

5,A Little Sprout No Doubt,"By now, most everyone has heard of the health benefits of eating broccoli sprouts.  The demand has driven the cost up to $3.80 for a 2-ounce carton at the few grocery stores that carry them.  Countless sprouters hawk their wares on the Internet selling both seeds and all sorts of fancy sprouting devices at a premium.  Add shipping to that.  Many growers make their own sprouters - and there are as many different designs as there are growers. Many websites show good pictures of these setups.  Most use glass jars with screen wire replacing the lid. After reading every bit of information I could find on growing broccoli sprouts, I ordered my first batch of seeds.  First off, at $20.00 a pound on Amazon.Com, these seeds  are $5.00/lb. cheaper than the competition plus Amazon offers free shipping.<br />I opted for a clear plastic jar in stead of glass for a sprouter. Glass and cats do NOT mix. I had to order three types of stainless steel wire before I got the size that was perfect.  Here's what works best for me. Stainless Steel Type 304 Mesh #16 X 16 .018"" Wire Diameter 12"" x 12"" available at Amazon for $8.62 with free shipping. #16 means the number of openings per lineal inch. Most craft stores sell scissors to cut wire mesh.  Fiskars makes a good pair.  Cut a circle 1mm larger in diameter than the mouth of your growing jar.  I use Folgers 12oz. coffee jars(38oz.liquid capacity) and cut out the lid with a Dremmel leaving only the rim with a 1mm ridge to the inside.  Insert the wire mesh circle into the top of the remaining lid. It should slightly bow outward but not so much that you can't rest the jar upside down with the lid on.(see attached photo image) Draining after washing is the part that gets tricky.  I read one website that said beat, slam, shake or do whatever necessary to thoroughly drain the sprouts after washing. So, I killed my first two jars of baby sprouts by blunt force tramma. They turned to mush.  Here's a secret I learned the hard way.  Wash the seeds/sprouts by swirling them in cold water for about 20 seconds.  Then, instead of violent slamming, simply place the growing jar upside down on a fluffed white paper towel.  After a minute, squeeze out the towel, refluff it and place it back under the lid.  No beating.  No knocking.  No shaking.  After ten minutes, your sprouts are well drained, still fluffed and happy.  The paper towel soaks the excess moisture through the screen better than any other method I've found.  Next, place the jar on its side in indirect sunlight between 66 and 70 degrees. I like a window sill behind a thin curtain.  Wash and drain twice a day.  For me, they grow much better when not compressed.  Two or three times a day, I'll rotate the jar about 90 degrees to allow them to gently tumble and bring submerged sprouts to the light. Another thing that seems to help is a very gentle air circulation flowing across the screen.  I have a small air cleaner/filter set on low about six feet away from the containers. From the first step of soaking the seeds to harvest, it takes me between 8 and 12 days. I understand that different varieties of seeds sprout differently and there are many variables to consider.  I wait until my jar becomes full of sprouts. Even the few seeds that don't sprout and the hulls are edible.  Some people remove these. During the final draining, most of the husks will float away and stick to the inside of the sprouter making them easy to remove. On average, 3 tablespoons of seeds yields 6.4oz of drained sprouts per jar. Based on the weights I'm getting on a postage scale, $20.00 in seeds yields about $90.00 in sprouts.  They are greener than the pale sprouts from the grocery store and taste much better, too.  This is a fun and productive hobby for the Winter months.  I have yet to come up with a cool growing idea for the Summer.  I'm thinking of a very small, shelf-type refrigerator set at 68 degrees and rigging it where the light will stay on inside.

5,Great solution for storage of Kcups,This coffee storage drawer is very well made and holds allot of K-cups. One of the things I like the best is that it doesn't take up much space because it is right below the Keurig coffeemaker. I took the advice of another reviewer and store the cups in an alternating fashion of one right-side up and the next one right-side down so you can store more cups than if they were all upright. I am very happy with the quality of this product and also like that the drawer has a stop on it so it won't fall out of the surrounding base.,positive,Great solution for storage of Kcups.

I am not that good at math but I know that that is ALOT less than ANY boxed wine deal, and you can re-up on ingredients from your local brew supply store to keep on experimenting with a variety of recipes.",positive,"on time and it delivers.

2,eh... it weaned me off my addiction. that's a plus!,"Ill say something positive first...The candy tasted ok for it being sugar free. I'm a fan of the jolly rancher gummy bears, so nothing will ever beat that. That's why I switched to this to cut down on the sugar. Instead this experience weaned me off gummies for sure lol I didn't think that would happen - ever. Anyways, every time a craving kicked in, I would forget my last experience and eat a handful. Mind you my hands are small, so within the hour my stomach would rumble and build up the most painful gas I have ever had. This would last for several hours and well into the next day. I had to squeeze my ass cheeks to keep the fart in until I was somewhere private several times to relieve the pressure only for it to build back up again minutes later. I thought it would be funny to play a prank on a friend of mine from this 5lb bag I bought that I was going to throw away well before even consuming less than a pound. If any of us lost, we had to eat 2 hands full of this candy. Of course I won, like I always do with him (haha) and it was so funny hearing him complain in anguish from the gas pressure.

There is less gravy in these cans than you find in ""regular"" store bought food, which means you get more actual food.

5,great flavor and plenty of heat,"This is one of my favorite hot sauces for general use on sandwiches, burgers, chicken, burritos, etc.  It is a mustard-based sauce with a nicely balanced flavor in which its other ingredients (red wine vinegar, onions, garlic, habaneros, ghost peppers, and spices) come through nicely.  I love the heat-to-flavor ratio, but your mileage may vary depending on how much tolerance you have for capsaicin.

5,Transcendental - you gotta try it.,"I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer.

It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.<br /><br />I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz).  While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh.

5,Sprouting lentils is easy and nutritious,"This is one of the best ways to get nearly complete protein from a vegetable. Use a wide-mouth mason jar (easier to clean) and a stainless mesh drain cover from your local hardware store. This makes daily rinsing easy. Soak overnight the first night. After that, rinse daily and drain well. Cover with the regular jar lid to keep moist. Takes about 3 to 4 days to get a quart of sprouts from one-third cup of dry. These lentils make very tastey sprouts, with a crunch like chopped almonds when cooked with par-cooked potatoes, sweet potatoes or other starchy vegetable. Eight minutes is enough. Don't let them get too long or green before cooking or they will taste a little grassy. Good raw rolled in rice paper with green onions and dipped, or on sandwiches.",positive,"Sprouting lentils is easy and nutritious.

4,"Very spicy, gingery, hard cookies","If you really like ginger and you enjoy hard cookies, Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps may be for you. The cookies have a very strong, spicy ginger flavor and a long-lasting peppery aftertaste. They're not very sweet, but they're sweet enough. They are very hard and crunchy, with more emphasis on the hard than the crunchy. If you have sensitive teeth, you should exercise caution. I picked up a hint of staleness; the hard-crunchy balance might have fallen on the crunchy side if the cookies had been fresher or had been packaged more quickly after baking.

4,A Very Good Oil,"Edited my review, upgraded to 4 stars. Received Fratelli's introductory case of 1/2 liter bottles of extra virgin olive oil today.  Read many reviews of 5 stars, 4 stars for the rest. I use a lot of olive oil.  Some reviewers say this oil is sweet as extremely good oil should be.  To me, it initially has a smooth, buttery, fruity olive flavor. A second or two later, it was peppery near the back of the tongue, followed by a slight bitterness further back on the tongue. Would not describe it as sweet. It is my understanding that many Italians prefer this pepperyness and I am Italian, but I do not.  Not sure if my sample is typical.  I feel this is a very good oil,and a great bargain at the introductory price, but not worth full price to me. I will stick to my Goya Extra Virgin First cold Pressed olive oil.......yes, Spanish olive oil.  No bitterness whatsoever, made from very ripe olives....my ""Gold Standard"" (Goya is very golden) I like my wine very full-bodied and fruity....hate wines that are very dry.  guess my tastes in olive oil and wine are congruent.",positive,"A Very Good Oil.

5,Hot Peppers Need Hot Weather,"I bought these from Think Geek instead of Amazon, and they're amazing.  However, I've seen several reviews with low ratings claiming that they never grew, so I thought I'd add my review with a few tips and tricks to growing these mind-blowing peppers.<br /><br />1) Ghost Chili's require hot temperatures to grow in.  More specifically, these pepper seeds will not germinate in soil that is under around 75 degrees Fahrenheit.  This means you need to grow them starting in late spring or even early summer if you don't want to use artificial means, to make sure its hot enough for them to sprout.  If you want to grow them earlier or in the winter, you may need to heat the soil yourself.  A simple heating pad wrapped around the pot set on low is typically sufficient.  Ideally they like 75-95 degree temperatures.<br /><br />2) You can affect how hot the peppers will be based on how you care for them.  The more stressed the plant is, the hotter the peppers will be.  Make sure you plant and feed your peppers while growing, but once they start producing fruit, cutting back on their water from time to time will make them hotter.  Also, if you cut back on the fertilizer (Nitrogen, specifically) while they are fruiting, you'll get hotter peppers as well.  Humidity also affects heat.  The higher the humidity, the hotter the pepper (good news for people in the South!).  And finally, the air temperature when the chili's ripen affect how hot they are as well, hotter it is outside, the hotter the peppers will be on the inside!  If you keep them unstressed and in a dry climate, the peppers will end up being sweeter.  They'll still be the hottest thing you ever put in your mouth though, so if you're not used to stressing plants without actually hurting them, its better to be kind to them than try to maximize their heat.  Its not like your tongue will know the difference between 850k and 1 mil scovilles anyway.<br /><br />3) Ghost Chili's like neutral to slightly acidic soil.  A PH of 5-6 is ideal, but your standard 6.5 potting soil will be just fine.  If you're not experienced with mixing your own soil, don't try it (you'll just kill the plants), use whats in the can and get regular mix from Walmart when you're ready to transplant.<br /><br />4) Don't grow these in the can.  Not that there's anything wrong with the can per say, it is rather small (picture looks like its coke can sized, its not, its maybe half that size).  You'll need to transfer the peppers to something bigger sooner than later, and they'll be rather young when they start to outgrow the can.  Moving them at that age is stressful, better to avoid it altogether by just starting with a larger pot to begin with.<br /><br />Ghost Chili's can be a little particular when sprouting, but they grow very well once started and they provide you with a once in a lifetime experience (because you'll never be dumb enough to bite into one a second time!).  For $10, you can't go wrong with these things.  And on the up side, after slipping a few of these into your cooking, you'll never be pressured to bring a side dish to a dinner ever again! ;)",positive,"Hot Peppers Need Hot Weather.

5,Robust coffee heaven in a cup (made with a Keurig),"This review is based on brewing with a Keurig using a reusable plastic kcup. I use a Keurig for my morning coffee on work days because it's fast and can make a decent strong cup with the right brand k-cup, like Emeril's Bold. Since I've been wanting to try Marley's coffee anyway, I thought I'd get these pods, open one, and pour the contents into the reusable plastic kcup that I bought on Amazon. And it worked!<br /><br />This coffee, when brewed as above in a Keurig on the medium cup size, produces a deep, rich, robust cup of coffee heaven. There's no bitterness,  just smooth, rich, deep flavor with a slight acidic tingle. It's not the blend for someone who likes light to medium blends. This is for the stout-hearted coffee drinkers only. I plan on buying a bag of beans and brewing them in my regular Cloer coffeemaker.",positive,"Robust coffee heaven in a cup (made with a Keurig).

5,"Good food, finicky cat","I have no complaints about the food at all; it seems to be a high quality, low phosphorus food for cats with chronic renal failure (CRF).  My CRF cat is really finicky though, but he eats it pretty good.  The food is very moist, which most cats seem to like.  I do mix even more water into the food to make a gravy, just so he gets extra water.  The food was shipped in a timely manner, and overally, I have no complaints.",positive,"Good food, finicky cat.

5,Fine Oil,"This Oil is great for those of you that don't like the taste of Olive Oil.  It contains more Omega 3 & 6 and a higher operating cooking range than Olive Oil.

5,Delicious vanilla milk,"I buy this on Amazon when it's on sale and it's great. I love flavored milk and this vanilla lowfat milk from Organic Valley is delicious.

5,Very pleased.,"This is the best gluten free spaghetti noodle I have used (although I must admit I have not tried Schar's spaghetti and it is probably good also as their other pastas are).  All of bionaturae pastas are excellent as well.<br /><br />After a little research on pasta there are some helpful hints that work with all types of pasta but are especially important with gluten free spaghetti.<br />Use as much water as your pot can hold, want good spaghetti, buy a bigger pot or use two pots that are appropriate for 6 ounces of pasta instead of 12 ounces.<br />*** Lots of water is vital to prevent spaghetti from sticking together.****<br />Too little water, the pasta becomes sticky as well as mushy.<br />NEVER add oil, I know it seems like a great idea but not only does not prevent spaghetti from sticking together but actually makes it more likely to occur.<br /><br />Adding salt to water is helpful but not necessary.<br /><br />Try adding your spaghetti very quickly, not slowly a few pieces at a time.  Again, it seems like a good idea but it promotes sticky & mushy pasta.  Why you ask?  Because all pastas gluten free and non gluten free release  a starchy substance that coats the pasta with in the first 2-3 minutes of being placed in boiling water.  This is commonly called glutinous starch but of course it is not the wheat, rye or barley protein gluten.  So adding individual strands prolongs this process of starch releasing and coating the strands of pasta increasing the likelihood of spaghetti stuck together. **** This is why is very, very important to use lots of water, and stir the pasta in the boiling water for the first 2-3 minutes to disperse the coating of sticky starch.****<br /><br />Then proceed with package directions on timing of pasta.  Of course I occasionally am distracted and boil the spaghetti noodles too long and am reward with mush.<br /><br />Best of Luck.<br /><br />PS my gluten free friend, Glutenfrieda is now making ice cream sandwiches that excellent.",positive,"Very pleased..

How you roast it, grind it, send water through it, serve it or drink it is up to you.  Lavazza probably didn't put the word ""espresso"" on it for one of two reasons: 1) In Italy it's just assumed that if you're normal you're having espresso (probably straight); or 2) Lavazza knows that you may do whatever the heck you want with their beans as long as you keep buying them.<br /><br />Lavazza Oro is a great coffee.  I love the caramel aroma when I first open the bag of beans.  I don't usually drink straight espresso, so I can't comment on how Oro fares as a straight shot.  It seems to make a really nice crema, though that is somewhat controlled by the grind and the machine.  I have a super-automatic espresso machine, and its manufacturer actually recommends NOT using darker, oilier roasts because they may gum up the grinder or brewing apparatus.

I switched my dogs over to Blue Buffalo and let me tell you they love it. It was an easy transition. I decided to order from amazon due to being on a lifting restriction of 20 lbs. I figured if I could get it delivered to my house it would save me the trouble of getting a stock boy at the local store to carry the items out to my car only to have to then wait till someone got home to help me bring it in to the house. The shipment arrived before the expected delivery date intact no issue with damage to the bag at all. Ups dropped it right on my porch where I keep the dogs food it worked out great. I highly recommend ordering this food, especially if you have issue with carrying the larger bags.",positive,"great senior food with the plus of easy delivery to my door.

She gets her vegetables this way, I'm happy knowing she is, and she sucks them down easily without spills. When she was little, 6-9 months or so, it was harder for her to figure it out without spilling everywhere, but still easier than letting her use her own spoon and baby food jar.

5,Delicious.....You'll like this so much you'll want the BIG bag,"Well, the manufactures of the Multigrain, FoodShouldTasteGood, tortilla chip has succeeded in their claim.....this chip does taste good.

The packaging looks (dare I say it) more sophisticated and ""adult like"" so you won't feel embarrassed to tote one around in your brief case (no orange tigers lurking around with artificial colors or flavors).  This blend between a chip and cracker taste quite good all in its own right but it is also great with dips and cheese.

1,Have ordered before but this shipment was unusable,"The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.

4,Pretty Damn Good Jerky,"I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.",positive,"Pretty Damn Good Jerky.

1,"Agree with ""basted not wrapped""","Like others, I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it. I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine, my dog LOVED them like always! When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being ""basted"" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product",negative,"Agree with ""basted not wrapped"".

5,one of the best,i originally got road kill grill as a gag gift from my brother in law but after we tried it we could not believe how good it actually is. but when i went back to were he got it to buy some more the store no longer carried it. after months of looking i thought why not try amazon and low and behold they had it. i bought twelve cans (two six packs) just in case they stop selleing it. i find it is best on porkchops or chicken but beef turns out dang good too. try it i dont think you will be disapointed.,positive,one of the best. i originally got road kill grill as a gag gift from my brother in law but after we tried it we could not believe how good it actually is. but when i went back to were he got it to buy some more the store no longer carried it. after months of looking i thought why not try amazon and low and behold they had it. i bought twelve cans (two six packs) just in case they stop selleing it. i find it is best on porkchops or chicken but beef turns out dang good too. try it i dont think you will be disapointed.

I tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing, if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues.<br /><br />Caution, it has 34 grams of sugar, and although natural, you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems.  34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar.

5,Love these wine crackers!,"I was first served these crackers at Grandfather Vineyards Wine Tasting Room near Boone, NC during a vacation trip this year. However, couldn't find them to buy locally when I returned home.  Thought I would try Amazon...and sure enough they had them!!!

The price for buying them by the case is $1.25 per box cheaper that what retail would cost and they will be a perfect compliment for my Christmas Gifts of Wine.

As today's prices go this one is selling for less per pound than most others even the ones we long ago deemed as positively undrinkable.

5,Great package design,"My baby (9 months old) is usually pretty picky, preferring mostly pears, apples, and squash, and she does very much like this juicy pear and garden greens flavor, but Since every baby's taste is different, this review is more about the packaging than the flavor.  It comes in a pouch with a great little screw top that, when removed, reveals a straw sized opening for you to squeeze the food through.  This is GREAT because it allows the baby to suck the food out, thus avoiding the SUPER messy alternative spoon feeding, however, you can't simply hand it to the baby and allow her to feed herself, because as soon as they squeeze it all squirts out.  That's not a big deal, I just hold onto it as she sucks, which is still easier than spoon feeding! The package also reseals by simply screwing the top back on, so you can store it for later feedings. Another thing that's really nice (for older babies) is that the package size is a larger 4.5oz, instead of the typical 4oz glass or plastic jars made by Gerber, Beechnut, etc. The package is great for traveling as well! It takes up a lot less space than the glass or plastic containers, so it's easy to toss in a diaper bag for a quick trip or pack a lot for a longer vacation! Overall, I like them a lot and would recommend them to any parent on the go!",positive,"Great package design.

5,Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH,"I'm normally rather ""meh"" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.",positive,"Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH.

Trying to get this problem resolved involved frequent interactions with customer service.

5,BEST TOASTER PASTRY,"These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure.",positive,"BEST TOASTER PASTRY.

5,Great taste for Fiber & Protein,"I just discovered these KIND Fruit & Nut, Almond & Coconut, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars at an airport. These were great.  They come in other flavors, but this is my favorite.  Almonds, because they are healthy, high in fiber and coconut is just yummy! Noticed they are sold in local supermarket but only in single bars, not by the box.  So, it is good to see them offered on Amazon and at a comparable, if not lower cost. I found them easy to munch on during the flight, filling (no meals on flight the flight) and was a great meal substitute with a bottle water.  I suggest you check the carb, fiber, protein content on each flavor as the % varies based on ingredients. I would not recommend these for anyone who wears dentures or braces, because they have a moist, but chewy consistency.  But, if you can take time to chew without worries, it's a very nice treat.",positive,"Great taste for Fiber & Protein.

The results vary by type of baked good, but it's never failed completely. Other than cakes, I haven't really noticed any difference when using this instead of egg. Pancakes were perfect.

2,2.5 stars - underwhelming,"I eat very few sweets, and haven't had a Chips Ahoy cookie in many years. But I remember some good ones. I looked forward to sampling these. I tried one. First thing I noticed is how dry the cookie dough was. It is soft, but after a bite or two I reached for a drink. The dough was just dry, and what I was searching for was some flavor. There might have been some, but I may have imagined it. Next, the inside. It is a bit gooey, and consists of a thin layer of chocolate fudgey filling. Very thin. I was surprised again at how little flavor I detected. I expected a rush of sweet sensation, because as I stated I seldom eat sweets. Usually when I do eat something with a lot of sugar, I immediately notice it. Not so here. There was a little chocolate flavor, to be fair. But far less than I was expecting. And hoping for. These reminded me of standard issue packaged cookies.<br /><br />Kids will probably eat these readily, without complaint. I'm not sure that's a reliable method of evaluation. Or maybe someone who regularly eats cookies is in a better position to grade these. Problem is, I used to be one of those people. I still remember the many happy moments between me and my cookies.

5,Another superb product from Nutiva!,It is what it is but I've noticed some differences between the white and the black.  I don't know if it's psychological but I swear the white ones fluff up more in water and there is less crunch in the final bite.  For those who are experienced in Chia seeds will know exactly what crunch I'm talking about.  I would say it's 99.9% white.,positive,Another superb product from Nutiva!.

5,If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee,"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.

5,My dog is addicted!!!,My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine.

I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal).

5,Tastes differ: yucky to some is best-ever to others,"My two favorite granola bars are Kashi chewy bars, all with the typical 7-grain mix: first Trail Mix, then Cherry Dark Chocolate; my spouse always opts for Dark Mocha Almond. To me, the Trail Mix bars are ideal: not too sweet, plenty of almonds, and good oats-and-granola crunch. The slightly sticky matrix is only enough to hold the bar together, without overwhelming the ingredients. The 140 calories (a bit less, for the other two bars) are nicely balanced: 6 g protein, 4 g fiber, 6 g sugars, and 5 g fat. No high-fructose corn syrup, no saturated fat, no cholesterol; low sodium (95 mg). Food, instead of candy (like the usual breakfast granola bar, with only 1 or 2 g protein) or medicine (the high-protein or high-fiber sports bars). I love the taste of Kashi Trail Mix, enough that I have to ration myself to two a day. Maybe the 1-star reviewer got a bad batch?

5,This is an incredible substitute!,"I found Arctic Zero Mint at Sunflower Market by accident and decided to try it. I was a little disappointed at first because it didn't have the texture of ice cream and was too hard to dish it out of the container. I decided to try it a few more times before giving up...  as real ice cream had packed on the pounds. One day I left a container out on the counter for about 15 minutes before opening it and surprise, surprise.... the texture was incredible! All it needed to do was melt a little bit. It was like eating the real thing plus the flavor were enhanced.  I give this flavor a 10+. I am eager to try the pumpkin and will probably order it in the near future. I've tried the other flavors but found this one to be the best. Although they all are good for some variety. It is pricey so you need to know that up front. But for me... as long as I can get them without going broke I will. I used to spend so much more money on binge foods so this is really not that bad. I do try to not eat a pint everyday but once I open one it's hard to stop. It satisfies craving for something cold and sweet. Plus...  it's zero in fat, 8 grams of fiber, over 12 grams of protein, and 150 calories for the entire pint. It's like having a frozen protein shake that actually has the texture of ice cream!

It was like eating the real thing plus the flavor were enhanced.  I give this flavor a 10+. I am eager to try the pumpkin and will probably order it in the near future. I've tried the other flavors but found this one to be the best. Although they all are good for some variety. It is pricey so you need to know that up front. But for me... as long as I can get them without going broke I will. I used to spend so much more money on binge foods so this is really not that bad. I do try to not eat a pint everyday but once I open one it's hard to stop. It satisfies craving for something cold and sweet. Plus...  it's zero in fat, 8 grams of fiber, over 12 grams of protein, and 150 calories for the entire pint. It's like having a frozen protein shake that actually has the texture of ice cream! Now that is terrific. I just found out that they make ice cream bars. I can't wait to try them all!"

Like another review said, I divide my package up into 5-6 servings...because it is soooo easy to just finish off the bag in a very short amount of time.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who has food allergies (because Enjoy Life foods are COMPLETELY free of the 8 most common allergens and some others besides), and anyone who just plain likes trail mix but doesn't want nuts.  ENJOY!!"
4,slightly bitter but very nice,"You have to expect 85% dark chocolate to be at least slightly bitter and these bars are just that.  If you are a sweet freak you will hate these bars.  I like them.  I'm always on the lookout for fair trade organic chocolate brands that do not cost an arm and a leg and ordered a case lot box of these from my food club at a very good sale price.<br /><br />These bars are made from whole ground cocoa beans (cacao) rather than from processed cocoa powder.  That makes them more healthy than most.  And because of the high cacao content you get a lot less sugar per ounce.  AND because they are not sweet and do not melt as smoothly in the mouth as some other brands (ex. Chocolove), I tend to eat less and that is even better for my health (and pocketbook).<br /><br />If you are looking for a dark chocolate to complement a dry red wine, I feel that this is not a good choice.<br /><br />Personally, I'm happy to have the Theo bars in rotation with the other 3 brands which I purchase.  If you are not sure about the 85% cacao experience, splurge and buy one bar at a retail store before you order in bulk.",positive,"slightly bitter but very nice.

2,Cats would rather eat the cheap stuff.

So, rather than throw away half eaten cans, I've been putting them outside for the strays, and even they aren't crazy about it.

Who knows.<br /><br />It's also not cheap, fortunately there is prime shipping on this.  I'd say overall it's a good deal considering how heavy this is to ship, so the price is justified in my mind.  At a little over $2/can, it's about what you'd pay at a whole foods, etc.<br /><br />It's worth noting that the large cans in other brands are typically *slightly* larger than this one (maybe 17 ounces), but it's hardly worth noting that.<br /><br />Final analysis: if you like sweet coconut water I think this is really the best brand to go for.",positive,"Best Tasting.

Luzianne has another winner of a product in this one and Amazon's price for a whole case of family size tea bags beats what I would have to spend at a grocery store anyway.  Thanks Amazon!"

5,"Better training recovery, much less pain, sleep like a baby","I discovered Peter Gilham's products a few months ago, and can speak for this product as well as the Osteo Calm, which adds calcium.  As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues. As magnesium pulls water into the gut, IMO it's the best remedy for sluggish elimination, and you must build the dose up slowly to prevent stools that are too loose.  For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.  Deeper and more refreshed sleep is also a main objective to any chronic pain condition.<br /><br /> I switched to the Osteo Calm a couple of months ago in my desire to add a better piece to my menopausal osteoporosis prevention, and have found that product to be completely awesome also.",positive,"Better training recovery, much less pain, sleep like a baby.

5,Best way to give glucosamine that I've found,"My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight.

5,Like having a coffee shop in my own house.,"I used to buy a mocha frappe every single day at my local coffee shop. Needless to say, it was expensive.

The chocolatey flavor is perfection in my opinion... and I'm very picky, having tasted many of these over the years.<br /><br />Also, one of the problems that I used to have trying to make mocha frappe's at home was that the ice would never get very well blended because my blender is a cheaper one, and I couldn't afford to buy a nice one like those in coffee shops that cost hundreds of dollars. With Ghirardelli frappe mix I don't have that problem anymore.

It is so good I'm signing up for auto delivery.<br /><br />If you like peaches and tea, this is the blend for you.<br /><br />As a side note I add about a 1 tablespoon of quality black tea to the 8 tablespoons of Peach Passion.  Also, I can brew this twice and still get full flavor (24 cups total).",positive,"An Office Favorite. Boston Tea provides some of the best tasting tea I have found.

4,SON LIKES THESE VERY MUCH WITH SOY SAUCE ADDED,"After eating the regular store cheap ramin noodles for years he was just sure no others could satisfy his taste.  I personally did not understand how he could like those at all.<br /><br />I bought these first in the spicy chicken and although a little spicy for his tummy, he became addicted to them and said he could never eat the old ramin noodles again.  He just  usually had to take his tummy medicine after eating. This time I ordered these not noticing that they had fish in them. This was  a larger size bowl which I thought would fill him up better. He said they are not spicy and good if he adds  soy sauce to them and he would like for me to order them again.  He says his favorite is still the spicy chicken and the ginger beef.  Ginger beef was not quite a spicy. We just wish these came in more  non spicy varieties particularly a non spicy chicken. Flavorful, but less spicy. Also, a little more of the added veggies in sauce mix would be nice.<br /><br />We have nothing against spicy , in fact, we come from New Mexico with the best in the world Hatch green chilies. It is a different kind of spice though and you can buy them in mild, medium and Hot. Some peoples tummies are just' fussy' when it comes to certain kinds of spicy.",positive,"SON LIKES THESE VERY MUCH WITH SOY SAUCE ADDED.

Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad.",positive,"Found the secret.

4,Refrigerator Helper,"I like having Betty Crocker Helper mixes in the pantry. They come in really handy on grocery shopping day. Inevitably there will be something that needs to be used up fast to make room for the newer product in the fridge. Usually it's the last of the milk. Sometimes it's the last stick of butter, or the last packet of cheese. Even leftover meat and vegetables can go in there. There is always something. Betty Crocker pasta meals are awesome for making those odds and ends disappear. The Helpers kind of need doctoring anyway, so the odds and ends wind up well used, and the Helpers are so cheap it makes sense to use them as a recipe starter. The Stroganoff is one of my favorites, partly because I like Stroganoff but also because it's an easy way to get rid of the last of the sour cream. Truthfully, all of the Helpers are great for using up odds and ends, but I'm nostalgically fond of the beef ones.",positive,"Refrigerator Helper.

I was a little concerned because it smelled kinda sweet, so I wasn't certain if it would alter the taste of my savory dishes. It made them taste better than butter ever did! After doing a little more research I found there are SOOOO many other beneficial uses. So, I have taken to using it on my hair and skin.

5,Deliciously Hot,"I love cayenne or other hot chilis in sweets like chocolate, and thought these sounded delicious!  They are!  The mango really does taste like a ripe juicy mango, and the heat adds a nice contrast.  The lime is also perfectly balanced with the hot.

4,"Effective protein & Fiber, though not versatile","When I first opened the bag, I was thrown off by the strong aroma, somewhat reminiscent of sage.

However, as with the smell, the taste became milder as I got used to it.

5,excellent healthy food,"When we first adopted our lab/border collie mix at eight months old, she was extremely underweight and had constant diarrhea. We didn't know what was wrong!

Her diarrhea improved a little bit, but her fur was thin and dull and she didn't seem as healthy as she should be. I did some research on grain free foods and switched her over to this formula. Immediately her diarrhea went away! She gained weight even faster, and now instead of skin and bones, she is a beautiful slender dog with tons of energy.

5,Really good,"This KIND healthy grains vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds granola is really good. The blueberry is subtle enough that it doesn't overpower the flavor, and the sugar is sweet, but not overly sweet.

In fact, all of the ingredients in this are just regular ol' stuff that you've most likely heard of. It's printed right on the front of the package: ""ingredients you can see & pronounce,"" and they mean it. Not only are the ingredients all just regular food, but you really can see all of them when you eat it. This stuff isn't coated in anything special to hide what it is, and it's not all ground up or anything into little pieces...it's all just right there and if you wanted to you could probably pick out all the different grains and stuff in it (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa, flax seeds). All this results in a granola/cereal that you can feel good about eating because there isn't anything weird in it; it's all natural ingredients and you can see what it is you're eating. There are supposed to be 11 servings within each package (each serving is 1/3 cup). I probably had between two and three servings when I'd be eating this for breakfast and it was plenty.

It isn't too tough, is a bit moist, and has a nice flavor. It is much softer than Tofuky Jerky beef jerky replacement, so the texture is easier to deal with, but this flavor is more sweet than the spicy Tofuky Jerky version. I'm excited to taste other flavors to see if there is something a bit on the spicy barbecue side rather than sweet barbecue side, but in general, I really like this and it might convince even the most skeptical meat eater.

5,Works Great With My Cat,"I've had several cats, most of which didn't have much of a hairball problem.  However, the cat I have now, has hocked up some epic hairballs.

In fact, after about a month of mixing this with her other food, I've noticed that she's only thrown up once or twice, and that's certainly not as much as she did before.<br /><br />I found this bag on Amazon for quite a bit less than what my vet charged, so I'll continue to order it here.

5,The SoyaJoy Automatic Soymilk Maker: Easy and Economical,"I've been using the SoyaJoy Automatic Soymilk Maker about once a week for almost a year now.  A deal at $99, the soymilk maker has paid for itself over and over again.  It's so easy to use; my favorite recipe is my own: Pineapple Soymilk.  All you have to do is soak soy beans overnight.  Thaw half a can of frozen pineapple juice; add the juice to the SoyaJoy along with filtered or bottled water.  Add a tablespoon of oat flakes to the soy bean filter, then add the soy beans; attach the filter to the unit, plug it in, and about fifteen minutes later, your soymilk will be done.  Let it sit for about half an hour to cool; chill overnight in the refrigerator, and enjoy.  Using a whole can of frozen<br />pineapple juice overwhelms the taste of the soy beans and additional sweeteners are not needed.<br /><br />I also prepare soy milk this way: soak overnight soy beans, a few raw almonds and raw Virginia peanuts along with about half a teaspoon of Basmati rice; next day, prepare Soymilk as usual.  I add the Okara (the residue that is left after the liquid is drained off when making soybean milk) to homemade soups as well as when I cook rice (I use a crock pot in both cases); the Okara adds something special to each meal.<br /><br />""The SoyaJoy Concentrated Magic Cleaning Powder"" is very easy to use, and aids in keeping the soy bean filter clean; in fact, I used the powder, as directed, only a few times, then one day I realized that I didn't need to use the powder anymore, and a simple cleaning was possible using water, the brush that comes with the SoyaJoy, and a sponge.<br /><br />If you plan on using the SoyaJoy often, you can pre-soak the soy beans; they keep up to a week in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator.<br /><br />I've been on the ""Blood Type"" diet for a decade; Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo says of his diet that soy-based foods are ""super foods"" for a Blood Type A.

Using a whole can of frozen<br />pineapple juice overwhelms the taste of the soy beans and additional sweeteners are not needed.<br /><br />I also prepare soy milk this way: soak overnight soy beans, a few raw almonds and raw Virginia peanuts along with about half a teaspoon of Basmati rice; next day, prepare Soymilk as usual.  I add the Okara (the residue that is left after the liquid is drained off when making soybean milk) to homemade soups as well as when I cook rice (I use a crock pot in both cases); the Okara adds something special to each meal.<br /><br />""The SoyaJoy Concentrated Magic Cleaning Powder"" is very easy to use, and aids in keeping the soy bean filter clean; in fact, I used the powder, as directed, only a few times, then one day I realized that I didn't need to use the powder anymore, and a simple cleaning was possible using water, the brush that comes with the SoyaJoy, and a sponge.<br /><br />If you plan on using the SoyaJoy often, you can pre-soak the soy beans; they keep up to a week in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator.<br /><br />I've been on the ""Blood Type"" diet for a decade; Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo says of his diet that soy-based foods are ""super foods"" for a Blood Type A.  Every time I walk by the soymilk section at the grocery store, I see an expensive way to buy that food; the SoyaJoy Automatic Soymilk Maker is the most economical and easiest way for a Blood Type A to enjoy ""super food""!"

Fed him right in the cart in under a minute and then we were on our way to finish the shopping trip in peace.  Fast, no messy bowls or utensils to carry around, and my kid loves them!  I've been hooked ever since and don't leave the house without them.  They are great while on long car trips or just running errands around town.  These are little pouches of sanity for any mom that's out and about with her baby.  I love the convenience and my kid loves the taste.  We've been using them for 3 months now, and my kid (now 12 mo) has since refused to eat jarred baby food, but will still suck these down without any complaints.

I had heard of people not caring for the last few drops of a warmed can, so I figured that it would be best to drink it before it had the opportunity to warm up.  What a great decision that was!  Shortly afterwards I felt a burst of energy surge through my body and I was more productive then I have ever been in my life.  Normally I would take a 8:30am nap at work, but not today.

It was almost like my favorite nutty bar, but there was something strangely healthy about it, which went against my sense of delectable unhealthy eating. if I wanted helth, I would have bought a saw dust granola bar. NOT. I guess if your doctor prescribes saw dust bars and you want a little peanutty flavor to them, and chew instead of the delightful crackle, get this one.

5,Water that's healthier than regular water? Maybe so.,"A friend of mine who is following an alkaline diet recommended Essentia water because of the higher pH level, so I gave it a try. My usual water selection is either filtered water with Brita system or store-brand bottled water (mostly Perrier). I compared the taste of Essentia water with my usual waters and found Essentia to be somewhat silky, but nothing really outstanding. I like the fact, however, that it provides some health benefit by alkalizing the body's pH balance.<br /><br />For those who don't know, alkaline diets emphasize eating fruits and vegetables, along with proper hydration, and are purported to lead to lower rates of cancer and disease. There is also some evidence that it lowers the risk for kidney stones and might slow bone loss and muscle degeneration, increase growth hormones, and even ease low back pain.<br /><br />I researched what is the pH for other popular water and found a test result from a website.

The dogs really liked these chews, but there are only four in a pack when you purchase the large size.  The chews were not long lasting (about five minutes).

2,I like Greenies but these are too tiny and snap in half,"I'm a fan of Greenies for dogs. However, this size is just too small and almost immediately snap in half.

I haven't tried one yet that I haven't really enjoyed, and the Chocolate Puerh is the latest on my list of must-have teas.<br /><br />As teas go, I think this is really somewhere between a tea and a chai. The ingredients are puerh tea, cocoa powder, vanilla, theo chocolate cocoa nibs, rooibos, orange peel, nutmeg, and cinnamon. All organic, of course!<br /><br />The first think I noticed when I opened the foil wrapper was the cocoa smell. Mmm. First scent was good. I steeped the tea for about 4 minutes (they suggest 3-5 minutes) and took a sip. The flavor is definitely tea, but there's the deep undercurrent of cocoa reminiscent of holiday baking and childhood treats. I think the rooibos and orange peel add a nice sweetness and slight citrus to the mix, and the cinnamon doesn't overpower the rest of the ingredients. Numi does a good job of balancing flavors.<br /><br />The tea bag wrapper says ""velvety & vanilla,"" and the tea does have a somewhat heftier mouthfeel than a regular cup of tea, probably because of the cocoa. I could drink this every day, but I'll probably savor it a couple of times a week as an after-lunch treat.

They don't crumble easily, so transporting them in one's pockets doesn't leave one with a gooey mess after doing laundry.  I'm pretty sure they are pricier than the treats one gets at the supermarket, but I'd spring for them once or twice a year for special treats, as opposed to the ""normal"" treats I give Bruno when he is doing what he's supposed to do even though he'd like to be doing something else."
5,Still great after many years,"I've been feeding Halo freeze dried chicken treats since 2002. I won't give them anything else because these are simply the best. All I have to do is call out ""treat"" and they all come running because they know they will get these. This packaging is new but I like the new package because it no longer takes up as much space as the cartons did and also that I can squeeze all the air out. The treat itself is still the same as it's always been and I've never had an issue with quality control.",positive,"Still great after many years.

5,KIND OF GREAT!,"Really love these bars for an on the go breakfast or a snack when I'm starving. The walnut/date are the best by far. I've tried a few others that were pretty good, but walnut/date tastes great-doesn't look so appealing though. I've had many co-workers stop and say ""WHAT ARE YOU EATING?"" If they only knew how good they are....:)",positive,"KIND OF GREAT!. Really love these bars for an on the go breakfast or a snack when I'm starving. The walnut/date are the best by far.

5,The best so far!,"Being from the Caribbean and living in Washington DC, I've been going through different products to see if I could find something close to the original. Well, I haven't tried all the products out there, but this weekend I saw this in a local food store and was sooo happy to see that it's sweet and good, not the awful artificially flavored ones that I've tried, even if it said 100% natural they tasted awful.<br /><br />Haven't compared prices but it looks like it's cheaper buying from here.",positive,"The best so far!.

5,Just as good as the original,"These sugar free Haribo gummi bears are nearly identical to the original.  I'm a huge Haribo fan trying to cut back on the sugar intake.  I personally couldn't tell the difference in taste but they are perhaps slightly softer.  My wife says she could sense a small taste difference, but only a very subtle one.<br /><br />The net effect is that if you're cutting back on sugar, be it for weight loss, diabetes, etc. these gummis will cure your craving.<br /><br />Shipping notes: shipping took about 5 or 6 days, arrived in a relatively large box, though the actual bag of gummi bears is only a little larger than your average bag of flour.  They were shipped with a cold pack inside to help prevent melting.",positive,"Just as good as the original. These sugar free Haribo gummi bears are nearly identical to the original.

5,"Strong cherry taste, more tart than sweet","These bars have a strong cherry taste, but because they have no sugar, they don't really taste like cherry pie. The bars have only three ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries. The almonds are chopped pretty finely, but still give the bar a bit of crunchiness. I love the taste, but if you're looking for something sweet, you might be disappointed. Each bar has 190 calories and 80 of them are from fat.",positive,"Strong cherry taste, more tart than sweet.
