" UNITEN is well-regarded, particularly for its strong engineering, computer science, and business programs. It has a solid reputation in Malaysia, especially in energy-related fields. The negative part is the facilities such as the swimming pool are close since my first year till 3 year now and there are limited parking so it's make hard to find.",uniten wellregarded particularly strong engineering computer science business program solid reputation malaysia especially energyrelated field negative part facility swim pool close since first year till year limit park make hard find
Neutral - Because currently UNITEN has developed various new facilities for UNITEN students such as 24 hours emart... Personally for the negative side I would say that UNITEN needs to fix the broken toilet in the library and BM/BN buildings,neutral currently uniten develop various new facility uniten student hour emart personally negative side would say uniten need fix broken toilet library bmbn building

"In my opinion, UNITEN is not really a student-oriented university even though it is a private university. The facility is not in well-maintained condition and the flexibility of using the facilities is low. The number of students also low compared to other universities.",opinion uniten really studentoriented university even though private university facility wellmaintained condition flexibility use facility low number student also low compare university
"UNITEN today is the shadow of its former self. What attracted me to UNITEN in the first place is not there anymore, e.g; our very own faculty building. The student dedicated website is terrible. I can name thousands of thousands website that is infinitely better. The hostel room application is ridiculous. The only pros that I could ever think of is the location of the campus that is situated near to major cities.",uniten today shadow former self attract uniten first place anymore eg faculty building student dedicate website terrible name thousand thousand website infinitely good hostel room application ridiculous pro could ever think location campus situate near major city

"UNITEN is a solid choice for students interested in engineering, IT, or energy-related fields, offering strong industry connections and modern facilities. However, its specialized focus and location may not suit everyone. If you’re looking for a university with a strong technical emphasis and ties to the energy sector, UNITEN could be a great fit. If you prefer a more diverse academic environment or a bustling social scene, you might want to explore other options.",uniten solid choice student interested engineering energyrelated field offer strong industry connection modern facility however specialized focus location may suit everyone you ’ re look university strong technical emphasis tie energy sector uniten could great fit prefer diverse academic environment bustle social scene might want explore option

I have faced a lot of problems while being in UNITEN such as internet connectivity and facilities is not in a good condition (air conditioning sometimes not working) .,face lot problem uniten internet connectivity facility good condition air condition sometimes work
"Uniten has great facilities, always give freedom for students to choose but some of the facilities upgrade is progressing very slow. The miscellaneous fee is still undefined. I think student should know what are they paying for.",uniten great facility always give freedom student choose facility upgrade progress slow miscellaneous fee still undefined think student know pay
"Uniten is unnecessarily expensive for the service it's offering. It is practically 10 times the price of a normal public university with barely any additional service. Most service center is broken, some road light doesn't even lit up and certain buildings are either close or straight up close off making the layout of the campus make less and less sense throughout the year. The service quality also isn't much better than the local ones therefore making the price tags makes less sense. The management side also isn't a huge downside. Schedule are a mess, events handled in exchange of student comfort and the report system keep making us report the same thing over and over again instead of putting on a timer or weight to solve the solution. Overall, 10/10, will never do this again.",uniten unnecessarily expensive service offering practically times price normal public university barely additional service service center broken road light even lit certain building either close straight close make layout campus make less less sense throughout year service quality also much well local one therefore make price tag make less sense management side also huge downside schedule mess event handle exchange student comfort report system keep make u report thing instead put timer weight solve solution overall never
"FIrst of all, UNITEN Strong point is the lecturer there are so many great lecturers here that have such precious knowledge they are willing to share. The course selection is abundance and align with modern world. Then, their proximity to bunch of food is very convenient. That what I could deem positive part about it. For neutral part of it, is their facilities, there are some good like the classes especially the new renovated class at BM, then we found poor class such as BV Theatre, then we have Library which is such a good benchmark for other theatre. The road is serviceable. Then for bad part is their management, slow, frustrating and could be very annoying. The event are subpar at best, the SRC is barely noticeable. In general, bunch of Uniten features, they are towards the right direction but lacking at execution.

"in my opinion UNITEN offers great opportunities in terms of exploring ourselves in preparing our future. but, there are many ways UNITEN makes the student life a ""hassle"". First for the longest times, the walkway for students and the bike road are damaged and filled with holes which will cause accidents and other issues. another is the issue with the admins in UNITEN UCC. although there are many whom help with the issue. Many are created with neglect of the Ucc staff.

"As a UNITEN student, I’ve had a great experience so far. Lecturers are knowledgeable and approachable, always willing to help when needed. The campus facilities are well-maintained, including the labs, libraries, and study areas, which make learning more convenient. The academic workload is challenging but manageable, and the curriculum is industry-relevant, preparing us well for future careers. There are also many clubs and activities to join, making campus life more enjoyable. Overall, UNITEN provides a balanced university experience with quality education and a supportive environment.",uniten student i ’ ve great experience far lecturers knowledgeable approachable always willing help need campus facility wellmaintained include lab library study area make learn convenient academic workload challenge manageable curriculum industryrelevant prepare u well future career also many club activity join make campus life enjoyable overall uniten provide balanced university experience quality education supportive environment
"Bad in management. Every sem had a problem about timetable and subject registration. Price per subject very expensive even not related to our programme. Dont have a lot of parking especially at the library. Timetable very very stressful, have class at night ",bad management every sem problem timetable subject registration price per subject expensive even relate programme dont lot park especially library timetable stressful class night
"UNITEN has great academic potential, but there are several areas that need improvement, particularly in its facilities and management. Many classrooms and lecture halls have outdated equipment, including malfunctioning air conditioning and inadequate seating, making it uncomfortable for students. The library, while resourceful, requires better maintenance, more study spaces, and a stronger Wi-Fi connection. Additionally, sports and recreational facilities need urgent upgrades, as the gym lacks proper equipment and some sports courts are not well-maintained, discouraging student participation in extracurricular activities.

The university’s management and administrative processes also require improvement. Response times from offices such as finance and student affairs are often slow, leading to delays in resolving student concerns regarding fees and scholarships. Course registration is another major issue, with frequent system crashes and unclear guidelines creating unnecessary stress. Moreover, communication between the university and students needs enhancement, as important updates about policy changes, events, and academic matters are not always effectively conveyed. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance the student experience and ensure UNITEN remains a top choice for higher education.

The managment system is the worst. The student could not get any time or study week before the finals and we could not get a longor period of time to settle down our pro forma invoice. ,managment system bad student could get time study week final could get longor period time settle pro forma invoice

Good education but for accommodation & facilities not so much,good education accommodation facility much
"In my honest opinjon, its neutral. Uniten got its good and bad side in it. Good things are the lecturers, environment, and education here are positive and non-toxic. Its quite peaceful here. The bad side are more on how the projection of the student's future and well-being. I've seen that the staff's and how uniten goes is not student-oriented. The courses are kinda old for certain subjects and not industry based. We also lack of business and entrepreneur funding for startups. We dont have the innovation, research, and startups environment here. If the environments are more competitive, and the uniten itself promotes the innovation and research culture, we could produce better future oriented students. Exposure is a guaranteed for them. But I believe jt requires both efforts from students and the uniten also.

"honestly, night class is such a huge hassle and big disadvantages to students.

"For residency, uniten need to create more space for parking and create designated area for student parking and it will be nice if theres a roof for parking, every event that held at dss, all the parking near dss will be closed, where should we park our car.

"As a final year student, I have a mixed review or opinion about UNITEN. I loved the education. The syllabus taught to students are very comprehensive and up to date to the industry standard. This prepares students in the working industry when they graduate.

As for the facilities, its quite poor in quality. Example includes, roof leakage, broken toilet and damaged roads. There is also poor security controls. Anybody can enter in and out of UNITEN whether they are a student or complete stranger. This poses a threat to all of UNITEN community from students to staffs. 

Would i recommend this university to someone i know? No i would not. There are other universities out there that are miles better than UNITEN. Make a proper research about the university before you enroll because you are going to spend 3-4 years there and potentially have a bright future ahead waiting for you.

"first I would say the facility where the student learn is very comfortable with comfortable chair and having aircon in every classroom. The food here is amazing and affordable.

I feel neither good nor bad towards UNITEN. There are some aspects that I like such as the courses & syllabuses taught to us students. They are relevant for our future because I’ve used those knowledge during my internship and they were shocked that I know such things. The environment itself is also not bad. Library is comfortable. Classes have full lightings to study in. What I dont like is the lack of concerns towards students’ practicality. Less parking spots. Difficulty to access uniten brighten or any uniten website during the release of examination results. Poor wifi connectivity.,feel neither good bad towards uniten aspect like course syllabus teach u student relevant future i ’ ve use knowledge internship shock know thing environment also bad library comfortable class full lighting study dont like lack concern towards student ’ practicality less park spot difficulty access uniten brighten uniten website release examination result poor wifi connectivity
